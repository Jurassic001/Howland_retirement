We are inside of a shared dissolve, as the pace and expectations of normality become a more staid and intimate life. This is our modern global pandemic. With his latest print Spring Shelter, Illustrator Laurent Durieux finds the humanity, the new-normal, of this communal experience. A woman lounges in bed with phone in hand, cat at her feet. A gorgeous spring evening spent indoors. Alone. The pool there to remind us of the possibilities of the season — pool parties, barbecues, and picnics, that will all go unexplored.

Spring Shelter is a 24″ x 36″ 10 color screenprint available as a timed-edition from Mondo. Availability ends 11:59 PM CT on Thursday, April 30. The proceeds will aid those affected by the pandemic. More on that from Mondo —

After costs, all proceeds of the timed edition poster will be split 50/50 between two causes that are very important to us: Direct Relief and the Alamo Family Fund.

Direct Relief is a humanitarian and nonprofit/nonpartisan aid organization with a mission to improve the health and lives of people affected by poverty or emergencies. The Alamo Family Fund was created to help Alamo Drafthouse employees who are facing financial hardship after a natural disaster or an unforeseen personal hardship including the global pandemic COVID-19, which has resulted in the unfortunate furlough of virtually all venue/theater members, and up to 80% of corporate staff.
